iCal

There is a bunch of awful timezone information 
There are some iCalendar libraries for Python. Could I use one of
those?

Bugs
----

https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/events/event_id/description/
- On some events you do not get the full description until you make a
  second API call. Ugh. This cannot be an expansion, either.
- I am not looking at locked statuses or determining whether events
  are private before publishing them.
