iCal
----

https://github.com/philippbosch/ical2json

There is a bunch of awful timezone information 
There are some iCalendar libraries for Python. Could I use one of
those?

Also adds carets for newline (^n), caret (^^) and double quote (^') 

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1590368/should-a-colon-character-be-escaped-in-text-values-in-icalendar-rfc2445
comma, semicolon, slash, newline

iCal readers
------------
claws-mail with vcalendar plugin (no calendar display)
(It does not render HTML well)

Probably I should just use Google calendar


Bugs
----

https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/events/event_id/description/
- On some events you do not get the full description until you make a
  second API call. Ugh. This cannot be an expansion, either.
- I am not looking at locked statuses or determining whether events
  are private before publishing them.
